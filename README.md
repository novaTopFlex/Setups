# Setups
A simple prebuilt repository for constructing C and C++ code; the code in this repository has intentionally been left incomplete.
## Notes
Base setups may not necessarily exist in all programming languages, but are found generally in the compiled languages only.
# Base.c
This version of the repository is intended more particularly for C code.
# Base.cpp
This version of the repository is intended for C++, initially intended as extensions to C and now a separate language.
